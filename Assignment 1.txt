Q.1 Explain JDK, JRE and JVM?

JVM : It stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is an abstract machine. It is a specification
	that provides a runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.

JRE : It stands for Java Runtime Envirnoment. JRE refers to the runtime environment.
	JRE refers to the runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
	IT is an implementation of JVM which physically exist.

JDK : It stands for java development kit. It is the necessary tool to compile. It contains JRE and Development tool.

Q.2) Why Java is platform independent?

Java is called platform independent because of its byte code which can run on any system.

Q.3) List down all primitive data types in java in order of their capacity.

	1. byte : 1 byte
	2. short : 2 bytes
	3. int : 4 bytes
	4. long : 4 bytes
	5. float : 4 bytes
	6. double : 8 bytes
	7. boolean : 1 byte
	8. char : 2 bytes

Q.4) Which of the following are valid variable names?
a. _$_$_$ b. my$Var
c. 1_emp_no d. good@str
e. $ 9 f. V$A$V

Q.5) State true or false. Rewrite statement correctly if false.

a. Java program compiles and interprets each time you execute it.  
	True

b. Java is platform independent but JVM is not. 
	False, Java and JVM is platform independent.

Q.6) What will be output of following code?
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int a = 5 ;
int b =20 ;
System.out.println(a++ + --b + --b + b/a + --a * b++);
System.out.println("a= " + a + " b= " + b);
}
}

	135
	a= 5 b= 19
